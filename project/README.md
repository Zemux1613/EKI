## Task
The goal is to read an arbitrary context-free grammar from a file and semantically enhance the production rules so that the following semantic interpretations apply:
- | ...for alternatives on the right side of a production rule
- [...]* ...for 0 to n repetitions on the right side of a production rule
- [...]+ ...for 1 to n repetitions on the right side of a production rule
- [...]? ...for optional elements on the right side of a production rule

Furthermore, a syntax tree is to be generated for the words which belong to the given grammar.
